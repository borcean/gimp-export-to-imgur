Export the image from your current GIMP workspace to Imgur.

Installation
============

To install this plugin, copy ``upload.py`` to your GIMP plugins folder. This
folder can be found by going to Edit -> Preferences -> Folders -> Plug-Ins.
By default on Linux, it is set to ``~/.gimp-2.8/plug-ins``, where 2.8 is your
GIMP version number. Restart GIMP and the plugin can be accessed under the File
menu.

Limitations
===========

Currently, this plugin has only been tested with Ubuntu. The plugin should work
with OS X and should only need minor changes to work with Windows.
